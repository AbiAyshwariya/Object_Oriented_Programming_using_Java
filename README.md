# Object_Oriented_Programming_using_Java
This project is a comprehensive Java-based implementation that demonstrates all four core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles — Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction — through real-world inspired examples and clean modular structure.
# Java OOPS Concepts 🚀

This project demonstrates all **four core Object-Oriented Programming principles** in Java through clean, real-world-inspired examples:

- ✅ Encapsulation  
- ✅ Inheritance  
- ✅ Polymorphism (Compile-time & Runtime)  
- ✅ Abstraction (Abstract Classes & Interfaces)

- ## 🎯 Key Concepts

| Concept       | Topics Demonstrated                                           |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Encapsulation | Private fields, getter/setter methods, controlled access      |
| Inheritance   | Base/derived classes, constructor chaining, method reuse      |
| Polymorphism  | Method overriding, runtime resolution, superclass references  |
| Abstraction   | Interfaces, abstract classes, loose coupling, modular design  |

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. **Compile all Java files**

'''bash javac src/OOPS/**/**/*.java'''

____
🧠 What You’ll Learn
How to use interfaces and abstract classes to create flexible designs
How to override methods and achieve runtime polymorphism
How access modifiers work and why encapsulation matters
How composition is more powerful than inheritance in real-world systems
